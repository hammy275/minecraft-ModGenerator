These are the sources I used to make this program

## Prerequisites

Python 2.7 (https://python.org/)
A Computer

## Running

Use Python to call main.py

```
python main.py
```

The program will then prompt you to input values. Input the values

Lastly, take the program's output and paste them into your mod code
wherever the program tells you to put them
